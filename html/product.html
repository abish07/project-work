         <p>This new Apple Watch is available in 41mm and 45mm sizes. While the wrist is down,
            the Always-On Retina display is up to 70% brighter indoors than the previous Watch,
            making it easier to see the watch face without having to lift the wrist or wake the display.
         </p> <br>
         <p>Apple Watch Series 7 features a redesigned front crystal with a stronger and more robust geometry
            that is over 50% thicker than that of Apple Watch Series 6, making it more crack-resistant.
         </p> <br>
         <p>The Watch has also been certified IP6X dust-resistant and has a water resistance rating of WR50,
            making it a good choice for swimming performances and making users stay relaxed while on the beach
            or the desert.</p> <br>
